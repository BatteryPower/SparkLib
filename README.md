SparkLib
--------

SparkLib is a modest collection of PHP libraries from your friends at SparkFun
electronics.

We find these useful; maybe you will too. That said, we lay no special claims
to originality or general applicability.  Interfaces herein are unstable, the
wheel is reinvented often, and most features depend on a recent stable release
of the language. Cleverness is avoided where possible.

Documentation, such as it is, can generally be found in the code.

Contents include:

* Autoloader - a simple, almost-standards-compliant autoloader
* Bugzilla - a very simple client for the Bugzilla API as exposed via XML-RPC
* Fail - a simple error and exception logging facility
* Math - math stuffs
* SocialNoise - quick and dirty display of search results for some social networks
* Template - a simple interface for using PHP files as templates
* Util - a miscellany
