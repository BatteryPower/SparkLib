SparkLib
--------

SparkLib is a modest collection of PHP libraries from your friends at SparkFun
electronics.

We find these useful; maybe you will too. That said, we lay no special claims
to originality or general applicability.  Interfaces herein are unstable, the
wheel is reinvented often, and most features depend on a recent stable release
of the language. Cleverness is avoided where possible.

Documentation, such as it is, can generally be found in the code.
